# TODO Vanilla JS

A simple TODO example using vanilla JS but featuring HTML import and Web Components.

Please use Google-Chrome. No polyfills are provided so it may not work on other browsers (yet).

## How to run locally

Clone/download this repository. 

Due to the fact that this example uses HTML import, you must use a web-server to load the page (eg: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```) and open the index.html.

## Architectural Design

The App is divided in 3 components: todo-form, todo-list and todo-item. The todo-form contains a todo-list. The todo-list contains a list of todo-item. The user enters new TODOs using the todo-form. 

The data flow is as follow: the parent components are allowed to call methods from it's children. But the only way a child is allowed to interact with it's parent is by dispatching events.

## Why this project was created?

To learn more about JavaScript and Web Components.

## This example is too complex!

Sure. You could do a much simpler TODO using plain JavaScript. But the goal of this project is to show how you can use vanilla JavaScript to create independent components and how they can interact with each other using a simple one-way data flow.

## Can I use something like this in production?

Probably not a good idea! ;) But if you do, make sure you are using HTML import polyfills (otherwise HTML import will not work on FireFox and other browsers).
