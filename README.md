# TODO Vanilla JS

A simple TODO example using vanilla JS but featuring HTML import and web components.

Please use Google-Chrome. No polyfills are provided so it may not work on other browsers (yet).

## How to test

Clone/download this repository. 

Due to fact that this example uses HTML import, you must use a web-server to load the page (eg: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```) and open the index.html.
